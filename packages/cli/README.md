# `@bb/cli` — context

## Tier

Binary (deployable). Top of the import graph alongside `@bb/server`.
Depends on Kernel (`@bb/types`, `@bb/errors`) and Infrastructure
(`@bb/config`). Imported by no other workspace package — published as the
user-facing `bytebell` binary.

May **not** import `@bb/server`, `@bb/queue`, `@bb/mongo`, `@bb/redis`,
`@bb/llm`, `@bb/ingest-github`, or `@bb/logger`. The CLI talks HTTP to a
running `bytebell-server` (when subcommands need server state), spawns
the server and `docker compose` as foreign child processes, and
otherwise operates only on `~/.bytebell/` via `@bb/config`.

## Responsibility

The user-facing terminal UI for Bytebell. Arch-spec'd at
[docs/arch.md _TUI Spec_ §144-184](../../docs/arch.md#L144-L184) — single
mode, every invocation is interactive in spirit, with subcommands for
indexing, configuration, server lifecycle, and inspection.

**v0 surface:** `set`, `boot`, `shutdown`, `server start`, `index`,
`ingest`, `ls`, `delete`, `stats`.

- `bytebell set <key> <value>` — headless write to
  `~/.bytebell/config.json` via `@bb/config.setConfigValue`. Type
  coercion + Zod validation + atomic `tmp → fsync → rename`. Sole
  sanctioned write path per [docs/arch.md:140](../../docs/arch.md#L140).
- `bytebell set` (no args) — Ink setup form. Walks Mongo / Neo4j /
  Neo4j-user / Neo4j-password / Redis / Port with field-level format
  validation. On submit, applies all six values atomically through the
  same `setConfigValue` path. Esc cancels.
- `bytebell boot` — one-command bring-up. Refuses to proceed if
  `openrouter_api_key` or `openrouter_model` is blank (with the
  matching `bytebell set …` hint). Auto-fills blank infra config keys
  with local-docker defaults (mongo / neo4j / neo4j-user / redis) and
  generates a random Neo4j password if one isn't already set. Writes
  `infra/docker/.env` (Neo4j password + host ports derived from the
  configured URIs), runs `docker compose -f
infra/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d`, polls
  `docker compose ps --format json` until all three services report
  `healthy`, then invokes `ensureServerRunning()` (existing helper) to
  spawn `bytebell-server`. Idempotent — re-running on an already-up
  stack is a fast no-op. When a compose host port is already taken,
  boot drops into an Ink picker (`PortConflictSelector.tsx`) offering
  three choices: reuse the existing service on that port (compose
  starts only the unconflicted services), stop the conflicting
  container and reuse the port, or change bytebell's host port for
  the affected service (mongo / neo4j-bolt / redis URI gets rewritten
  via `setConfigValue`, compose env is regenerated, retry). Up to
  four conflict rounds before giving up.
- `bytebell shutdown` — sends SIGTERM to the server PID, polls until
  the PID file vanishes (≤ 30 s), then asks (Ink prompt
  `StopInfraPrompt.tsx`) whether to stop Docker infra too. Default
  answer is **Yes** (Enter tears down `mongo + neo4j + redis` via
  `docker compose down --remove-orphans`); pressing `n` / Esc keeps the
  containers running for fast warm re-boots and prints the manual
  `docker compose down` hint. The prompt is skipped when stdin isn't a
  TTY (CI-safe — falls back to keeping infra up). Two flags override
  the prompt deterministically: `--with-docker` always stops infra,
  `--keep-docker` always leaves it running; passing both is rejected.
- `bytebell server start` — low-level wrapper that spawns the server
  in the foreground (Ctrl+C to stop). Used during dev; everyday users
  prefer `bytebell boot`.
- `bytebell index <git-url>` / `bytebell ingest [path]` / `bytebell ls`
  — talk HTTP to a running server (lazy-spawn via
  `serverSpawn.ensureServerRunning` when the daemon is down). `ls` supports
  an interactive mode (`-i`) for hierarchical browsing of repos and commits.
- `bytebell delete` — list indexed knowledge in an Ink arrow-key picker
  (`DeleteSelector.tsx`, plain `useInput` — no extra dep), and on
  confirm `DELETE /api/v1/repos/:id` against the running server. The
  server cancels any pending BullMQ jobs, then `DETACH DELETE`s the
  Neo4j subgraph and removes the Mongo `knowledge` / `raw` /
  `processing_stats` rows for that id.
- `bytebell stats` — `GET /api/v1/stats` and render TOTALS / REPOS /
  COMMITS tables. Cost is per-model OpenRouter pricing computed
  server-side; rows with unknown pricing render as `unknown`.
- `bytebell --help` / `--version` — commander defaults.

The package does **not** own:

- Any other subcommand (index, ls, clean, models, keys, cost, server,
  mcp, update) — all deferred per the catalog below.
- Live infra connection probes — the CLI cannot import `@bb/mongo` /
  `@bb/redis` per the tier rule. Format-only validation in v0; future
  `bytebell config doctor` will probe via a running server.
- The Ink dashboard (`bytebell` no-args) — needs the server's HTTP API
  - activity feed.
- OpenRouter API key handling — own subcommand (`bytebell keys set`)
  with `keytar` keychain backing.

## Public exports

`@bb/cli` is a binary, not a library. Its only contract is the `bin`
entry in `package.json`:

```jsonc
{ "bin": { "bytebell": "./src/index.ts" } }
```

Publish-time builds swap to `./dist/index.js`. v0 dev workflow runs the
TS file directly via Bun's `#!/usr/bin/env bun` shebang; install with
`cd packages/cli && bun link` to put `bytebell` on `PATH`.

The TypeScript module exports (`buildSetCommand`, `KEY_MAP`, etc.) are
**internal** — no other workspace package imports `@bb/cli`.

## Data ownership

None directly. The CLI is a thin shell over `@bb/config`'s atomic
writer — it owns no module state, no caches, no on-disk artifacts of its
own. `~/.bytebell/config.json` is `@bb/config`'s data; CLI just writes
through it.

## Invariants

1. **No env reads.** No `process.env`. The setter primitive enforces
   this; the CLI is a transparent caller.
2. **Atomic writes.** Every successful `set` invocation triggers
   `setConfigValue` which writes via `tmp → fsync → rename` at mode
   `0600` in dir `0700`.
3. **Tier discipline.** No imports from `@bb/server`, `@bb/queue`,
   `@bb/mongo`, `@bb/redis`, `@bb/llm`, `@bb/ingest-github`. Blocked
   structurally (no workspace dep) and by ESLint boundary rule.
   Foreign processes the CLI is allowed to manage by signal:
   `bun … packages/server/src/index.ts` (the server daemon) and
   `docker compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.yml …` (the local
   infra). Both are spawned via `child_process.spawn` — neither is
   an in-process import.
4. **Redaction in stdout.** Password-bearing keys
   (today: `neo4j-password`, `openrouter-api-key`) print `<redacted>`
   on success — the raw value never appears in stdout / stderr / logs.
5. **`openrouter-api-key` and `openrouter-model` are headless-set
   keys** in `KEY_MAP`. The api key is `redact: true`; the model is
   plain text. The pre-flight inside `bytebell boot` blocks bring-up
   until both are non-empty.
6. **Format-only validation in v0.** The setup form's per-field
   validators check shape (`mongodb://`, `bolt://`, integer port, etc.)
   but never make network calls.
7. **TUI naming convention.** `*Command.ts` for commander handlers
   (plain TS), `*Form.tsx` / `*Pane.tsx` for Ink components (JSX).
   Per [CLAUDE.md _Naming Conventions_](../../CLAUDE.md).

## External dependencies

- `commander` — argv parsing + subcommand wiring
- `ink` + `react` — Ink TUI runtime (React for terminals)
- `ink-text-input` — controlled text input field
- Workspace deps: `@bb/config`, `@bb/errors`, `@bb/types`

No `chalk` / `kleur` / `picocolors` — manual ANSI escapes wrapped
behind a `tty?` check (see `output.ts`).

## Migrations

- `bytebell migrate paths [--dry-run]` — one-shot move of the legacy
  on-disk layout (`~/.bytebell/repos/<id>/` for clones,
  `~/.bytebell/repos/.meta/<id>/...` for meta) into the commit-scoped tree
  (`~/.bytebell/orgs/<orgId>/<provider>/<knowledgeId>/<owner>/<repo>/<commit>/...`).
  The disk work lives in `@bb/path-migration`; this command supplies the
  Mongo knowledge list and renders the summary. The **same reconciliation runs
  automatically at server boot** (see `@bb/server`), so this command is for
  running it ahead of time or with `--dry-run` to preview. `--dry-run` prints
  the plan (including would-be-deleted orphans) without touching disk. Reads
  `KnowledgeDoc` from Mongo to derive each knowledge's
  `(orgId, owner, repo, commitId)`; knowledges that predate commit tracking
  (no `source.commitId`) or have no `info.repoUrl` are skipped with a per-id
  reason and need manual `bytebell delete` + re-index. Legacy dirs with **no**
  backing `KnowledgeDoc` are unrecoverable — they are deleted and reported as
  `abandoned`. Local-source knowledges keep their original `source.sourcePath`
  untouched; only their `meta-output` tree moves.

## What is intentionally out of scope (v0)

- Every TUI surface in the table above except `set` and the help/version
  defaults
- Live connection probes inside the setup form
- First-run auto-launch of setup form (needs the dashboard pane first)
- OpenRouter API key in the setup form (separate `bytebell keys set`)
- Tests — workspace has no test infra yet
- Color theming via `kleur` / `picocolors` — manual ANSI for now
- Distinct exit codes per failure mode (today: `1` = typed/handled error,
  `2` = uncaught crash)

## How to extend

Adding a new subcommand:

1. Create `src/<Name>Command.ts` (PascalCase, plain `.ts`) exporting
   `build<Name>Command(): Command`.
2. If interactive panes / forms are needed: add `src/<Name>Form.tsx`
   (or `<Name>Pane.tsx`) per [CLAUDE.md _Naming Conventions_](../../CLAUDE.md).
3. Wire into `src/index.ts`: `program.addCommand(build<Name>Command())`.
4. If the command speaks to `bytebell-server`: HTTP only (e.g. `fetch`
   to `http://localhost:<server_port>`). Never import `@bb/server`.
5. If the command needs OS primitives (`keytar`, `bun:sqlite`,
   `child_process`): add the dep to `package.json`, but never import a
   domain / strategy / infra-non-config workspace package.
6. Update _Public exports_ / _Out of scope_ in this file and the table
   above — move the row from "deferred" to "shipped".

Adding a new headless `set` key:

1. Add a `Config` enum entry in `@bb/types/src/config.ts` (and the
   schema / hint in `@bb/config`).
2. Add a `KEY_MAP` entry in `src/keyMap.ts`. The closure form keeps
   `setConfigValue<K>(key, ConfigValue<K>)` strictly typed.
3. If the key is interactive-form-relevant: add a `Row` to the
   `ROWS` array in `src/SetupForm.tsx` with a `validate` function.
