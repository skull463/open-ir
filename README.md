# Bytebell [bytebell.ai]

## Quickstart

> Looking for the full CLI reference? Every `bytebell` subcommand, flag, and option lives in **[commands.md](commands.md)**. The Quickstart below is the minimum sequence from zero to a queryable graph.

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) ≥ 1.1 — runtime + workspace manager.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) — for the local Mongo + Neo4j + Redis stack `bytebell boot` brings up.
- An [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) API key — every per-file analysis call goes through OpenRouter.

### Install

See [commands.md](commands.md) for install steps. Once installed, verify with `bytebell --help`.

### Configure

Two values Bytebell needs — your OpenRouter API key and model. Set them headlessly:

```bash
bytebell set openrouter-api-key sk-or-…
bytebell set openrouter-model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6
```

Or skip this step and run `bytebell boot` straight away — on an interactive terminal it opens a setup form to collect these on first run. Running `bytebell set` with no arguments opens the same form at any time.

There is no `.env` file anywhere. `~/.bytebell/config.json` (mode `0600`) is the single source of truth, and `bytebell set` is the only sanctioned way to write to it. If you already run Mongo / Neo4j / Redis and don't want the Docker stack, see [Bring your own infrastructure](#bring-your-own-infrastructure) below.

### Boot

```bash
bytebell boot
```

What happens, in order:

1. **Pre-flight check** — verifies both OpenRouter keys are set. If either is blank and you're in an interactive terminal, Bytebell opens a setup form so you can enter them on the spot, then continues. In a non-interactive context (CI, piped input) it prints the exact `bytebell set …` commands and exits.
2. **Auto-fill** — fills any missing infra config keys with local-Docker defaults; generates a Neo4j password if one isn't set.
3. **Stack up** — `docker compose up -d` brings up `bytebell-mongo`, `bytebell-neo4j`, `bytebell-redis` (named volumes — data persists across reboots).
4. **Health gate** — polls `docker compose ps` until all three services report `healthy`.
5. **Server up** — spawns `bytebell-server` (HTTP on `127.0.0.1:8080`, MCP at `/mcp`).

First boot pulls images and can take a couple of minutes. Subsequent boots are fast.

### Index a repo

```bash
bytebell index https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code
# private repo: add --token <github-pat>; never paste the PAT positionally
bytebell ls   # watch state: CREATED → QUEUED → INGESTED → PROCESSING → PROCESSED
```

When the row reads `PROCESSED`, the graph is fully populated and the MCP tools will return results for that repo. Local directories work too: `bytebell ingest /path/to/source-tree`.

### Connect an MCP client

| Client         | Setup                                                                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code    | `claude mcp add --transport http bytebell http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp` |
| Claude Desktop | Add the JSON snippet below to your MCP config file                   |
| Cursor         | Same JSON snippet in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`                            |
| Continue       | Same JSON snippet in `~/.continue/config.json`                       |

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bytebell": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

The server registers `smart_search`, `keyword_lookup`, and `retrieve_file`, plus a bundled skill at `bytebell://skills/index` that the client can fetch and install once per session for the recommended workflow.

## What Bytebell does

You point `bytebell` at a repo. It clones the source, walks every file, and for each file calls an LLM (via OpenRouter) to extract a structured `FileAnalysis`: a one-paragraph **purpose**, a longer **summary** of what the file does and how it fits the architecture, a **business context** line tying it to the product domain, plus the file's classes, functions, keywords, and imports.

Those outputs are persisted into two stores:

- **Neo4j** receives a `:File` node enriched with `purpose`, `summary`, `businessContext`, `language`, `sha`, and `sizeBytes`, linked via `:HAS_CLASS`, `:HAS_FUNCTION`, `:HAS_KEYWORD`, `:HAS_IMPORT_INTERNAL`, and `:HAS_IMPORT_EXTERNAL` to deduplicated child nodes shared across the whole graph. Fulltext indexes cover purpose+summary, business context, keyword names, and class/function signatures.
- **MongoDB** receives the raw file content, language, SHA256, and the full `FileAnalysis` JSON for cite-back and exact retrieval.

LLM clients then query that graph through three MCP tools — `smart_search`, `keyword_lookup`, `retrieve_file` — which together cover fused semantic + structural search, reverse entity-to-file lookup, and targeted content reads. They let an agent answer questions like _"Which files implement our retry/backoff policy and where is it configured?"_ without reading the entire repo into context.

```

## Who this is for

- **Solo engineers and small teams** who want a Claude / Cursor / Continue session to _actually_ know their codebase — not just whatever the tool can fit in a context window — without sending source to a third party.
- **OSS communities and academic research groups** who need a durable, reproducible code-knowledge index they can re-index from a single command.
- **Anyone running an MCP-capable agent on a private codebase** where compliance, IP, or just personal preference rules out hosted RAG-over-your-repo SaaS.

It is **not** a hosted product, not a chat UI, and not a multi-tenant platform. There is exactly one tenant — `orgId="local"` — and the server binds to `127.0.0.1`. If you want hosted, multi-tenant, or commercial-use rights, see the [Enterprise](#enterprise) section.

## How it works

### Ingest

`bytebell index <url>` (or `bytebell ingest <path>`) submits a job to an in-process BullMQ queue. The worker dispatches to an `IngestionStrategy` — today, `BasicFileAnalysisStrategy` ([packages/ingest-github/src/BasicFileAnalysisStrategy.ts](packages/ingest-github/src/BasicFileAnalysisStrategy.ts)). It clones the repo to `~/.bytebell/repos/<knowledgeId>/`, walks every file, runs a per-file OpenRouter call, and persists raw content to Mongo + the enriched node to Neo4j.

The per-file LLM call returns a single JSON object with this shape:

```jsonc
{
  "purpose": "Why this file exists. Max ~300 tokens.",
  "summary": "What it does, key patterns, architecture role. Max ~600 tokens.",
  "businessContext": "Product/domain impact. 2–3 lines, max ~100 tokens.",
  "classes": ["ExactName (~L3-29): What it represents", "..."],
  "functions": ["exact_name (~L42-58): Primary responsibility", "..."],
  "keywords": ["domain-term-1", "domain-term-2", "..."],
  "importsInternal": ["./relative/paths.ts", "..."],
  "importsExternal": ["express", "neo4j-driver", "..."],
}
```

`classes` and `functions` carry approximate line ranges so `retrieve_file` can later pull the right slice without re-reading the whole file. **Re-indexing is diff-aware**: on `bytebell pull`, the strategy compares each file's SHA256 to the prior `:File.sha` and only re-analyses files whose hash changed. LLM cost is proportional to actual code churn, not to repo size.

### Graph shape

```mermaid
graph LR
    K[":Knowledge"]
    F[":File<br/>purpose, summary,<br/>businessContext"]
    KW[":Keyword"]
    C[":Class"]
    Fn[":Function"]
    M[":Module"]
    K -- HAS_FILE --> F
    F -- HAS_KEYWORD --> KW
    F -- HAS_CLASS --> C
    F -- HAS_FUNCTION --> Fn
    F -- HAS_IMPORT_INTERNAL --> M
    F -- HAS_IMPORT_EXTERNAL --> M
```

One `:Knowledge` node per indexed repo owns its `:File` nodes. Each `:File` carries `purpose`, `summary`, `businessContext`, `language`, `sha`, `sizeBytes`, and a `relativePath` unique within its `knowledgeId`. From every file, the five `:HAS_*` edges link to deduplicated `:Keyword`, `:Class`, `:Function`, and `:Module` nodes that are global across the whole graph — the same library, the same exported function, the same domain term resolves to one node no matter how many repos reference it. Constraints make `(knowledgeId, relativePath)` unique on `:File`; fulltext indexes back the natural-language search side. Source: [packages/neo4j/src/files.ts](packages/neo4j/src/files.ts), [packages/neo4j/src/indexes.ts](packages/neo4j/src/indexes.ts).

There are no cross-file call edges in the current schema — that's a deliberate tradeoff for ingestion simplicity and language-agnostic ingest. Future strategies will add them, plugged in behind the same `IngestionStrategy` interface.

### Retrieval

Three MCP tools, registered at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp`:

- **`smart_search(query, k=20)`** — fused six-channel search across File `purpose`/`summary`, `businessContext`, paths, keyword names, class/function signatures, and module imports. Returns deduplicated, ranked top-K files with folder clustering. Use first.
- **`keyword_lookup(term)`** — reverse lookup. A search term resolves to all matching named entities (keywords, classes, functions, module names) and the files linked to each.
- **`retrieve_file`** — three operations: `metadata` (purpose, summary, businessContext, classes/functions with line ranges, imports), `content` (read specific line ranges or search within one file with surrounding context), `bulk_search` (parallel scan of up to 50 files for a string).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Q["Question from agent"] --> SS["smart_search"]
    SS --> KL["keyword_lookup<br/>(optional)"]
    SS --> RM["retrieve_file metadata<br/>→ class/function line ranges"]
    KL --> RM
    RM --> RC["retrieve_file content<br/>→ exact line slice"]
    RC --> A["Cited answer"]
```

Most well-formed code questions resolve in 2–4 tool calls. No re-clone, no full-file dumps, no embeddings round-trip.

## Bring your own infrastructure

By default, `bytebell boot` provisions a local Docker stack (`bytebell-mongo`, `bytebell-neo4j`, `bytebell-redis`) with auto-generated credentials. If you already run Mongo, Neo4j, and Redis (or want to use a managed service), set the connection details before booting and the Docker step is skipped:

```bash
bytebell set mongo-uri      mongodb://user:pass@host:27017/bytebell
bytebell set neo4j-uri      bolt://host:7687
bytebell set neo4j-user     neo4j
bytebell set neo4j-password <your-password>
bytebell set redis-url      redis://host:6379
```

Docker is not required on the host in this mode. See the [Configuration reference](#configuration-reference) for the full key list.

## Architecture at a glance

A single Bun-built Express daemon, `bytebell-server`, hosts the ingestion HTTP routes, the MCP transport (Streamable HTTP + SSE), and the BullMQ workers all in-process. The CLI is a thin Ink/React TUI that only ever talks HTTP to that daemon — it never touches Mongo, Neo4j, or Redis directly. Workers run in the server's lifecycle; there is no separate worker fleet.

For the full PRD — package tiers, state machine, HTTP route catalogue, verification checklist, distribution strategy — see [docs/arch.md](docs/arch.md).

## Configuration reference

Settings live in `~/.bytebell/config.json` and are written exclusively by `bytebell set <key> <value>` (or by first-run auto-fill on `bytebell boot`). Keys:

| Key                  | Purpose                                  | Default                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `openrouter-api-key` | API key for per-file LLM analysis        | _(required, blank by default)_       |
| `openrouter-model`   | OpenRouter model slug used for analysis  | _(required)_                         |
| `mongo-uri`          | MongoDB connection string                | `mongodb://localhost:27017/bytebell` |
| `neo4j-uri`          | Neo4j Bolt URI                           | `bolt://localhost:7687`              |
| `neo4j-user`         | Neo4j auth user                          | `neo4j`                              |
| `neo4j-password`     | Neo4j auth password                      | _(generated on first boot)_          |
| `redis-url`          | Redis URL for BullMQ                     | `redis://localhost:6379`             |
| `server-port`        | Local HTTP/MCP port                      | `8080`                               |
| `concurrency-github` | Concurrent files analysed per GitHub job | tuned per box                        |
| `log-level`          | Winston log level                        | `info`                               |
| `log-retention-days` | Daily log retention                      | `14`                                 |

If a required setting is missing, Bytebell either opens the setup form (interactive terminal) or prints the exact `bytebell set …` command and refuses to boot (non-interactive). It never silently reads `process.env`.

## Why this design — research grounding

> Comparing Bytebell to PageIndex, GitNexus, GraphRAG, Sourcegraph, or Augment Code? See **[comparison.md](comparison.md)** for a side-by-side feature table and pros / cons of each.

Bytebell's shape — _build a code graph at ingest time, enrich every node with LLM-derived structured semantics, then serve retrieval against the joined surface_ — tracks a converging body of recent work showing that purely structural retrieval (AST / call-graph) and purely semantic retrieval (embeddings) each leave large performance on the table, and that combining them at indexing time unlocks the gains.

**Graphs beat flat retrieval for code.** Repository-level graphs from AST + imports + call structure consistently outperform flat embedding retrieval on real engineering tasks.

- RepoGraph ([2410.14684](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14684), ICLR 2025) — +32.8% on SWE-bench.
- CodexGraph ([2408.03910](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03910), NAACL 2025) — agents query a code graph DB; beats similarity-only retrieval.
- CGM ([2505.16901](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16901)) — graph + node semantics; 43% on SWE-bench Lite.
- Citation-Grounded Code Comprehension ([2512.12117](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12117)) — argues LLM-only and embedding-only both fail; hybrid wins.

**LLM-generated semantic enrichment closes the vocabulary gap.** Identifiers and call edges don't capture intent — natural-language summaries on each node let retrieval match what a developer _means_, not just what the code _spells_.

- Tram ([2305.11074](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11074), ACL 2023) — semantic enrichment beats flat sentence-level retrieval.
- LLM Agents Improve Semantic Code Search ([2408.11058](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11058)) — LLM-injected metadata improves embedding-based retrieval.
- Knowledge-Graph-Based Repo-Level Code Generation ([2505.14394](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14394)) — graph captures structure; LLM context fills semantic gaps.
- Sense and Sensitivity ([2505.13353](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13353)) — lexical and semantic recall are different capabilities; supports the `summary` (semantic) vs Mongo raw (lexical) split.

**Structured summaries and hierarchy beat blob summarization.** Explicit fields — purpose, inputs, outputs, business context — aggregated bottom-up let retrieval match at the right level of abstraction. This maps directly onto Bytebell's `purpose` / `summary` / `businessContext` schema.

- Hierarchical Repo-Level Code Summarization for Business Applications ([2501.07857](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07857), ICSE LLM4Code 2025) — closest motivational match: structured per-unit summaries aggregated to file/package level, grounded in business context.
- Beyond Function Level ([2502.16704](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16704)) — class/repo context in summaries beats function-only.
- Code-Craft ([2504.08975](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08975)) — closest published peer; bottom-up LLM summaries from a code graph; +82% top-1 retrieval precision on 7,531 functions.
- Hierarchical Summarization (Springer 2025) — project/dir/file summaries at indexing time; Pass@10 of 0.89 on real Jira issues, beats flat retrieval and standard RAG.

**Hybrid structure + semantics, served as memory.** The most recent work converges on serving the joined graph through a memory-style retrieval interface — exactly what MCP gives us.

- Codebase-Memory ([2603.27277](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.27277)) — MCP-served knowledge graph with LLM-derived metadata; reports 10× token reduction.

The design choices follow directly: each `:File` node carries LLM-generated semantics alongside `:HAS_CLASS` / `:HAS_FUNCTION` / `:HAS_KEYWORD` / `:HAS_IMPORT_*` edges (structure), and the three MCP tools fuse both surfaces at query time.

## Enterprise

Bytebell-public is the OSS edition. ByteBell also offers a separately-licensed **Enterprise** edition for organizations that need a commercial-use grant, hardening, and direct support. Enterprise typically includes:

- A commercial-use grant covering use by or on behalf of for-profit entities, including SaaS deployments and revenue-generating applications.
- Hardened multi-tenant deployment patterns, SSO / SCIM, audit logging, and data-isolation guarantees.
- Additional ingestion strategies (cross-file call graphs, dependency-graph extraction, PDF and design-doc ingestion) and additional MCP tools.
- Access to the managed ByteBell knowledge surface and connectors to internal sources (Confluence, Jira, Notion, GitHub Enterprise, …).
- Engineering support and SLAs for production deployments.
