# `@bb/mongo` — context

## Tier

Infrastructure. Depends on Kernel (`@bb/types` for `Config` and
`KnowledgeState`, `@bb/errors` for typed error classes) and on infra
siblings explicitly listed in `package.json` (`@bb/config` for
`Config.MongoUri`). May be imported by Strategy (`@bb/queue`), Domain,
and Binaries — never by `@bb/cli` (CLI talks HTTP only).

## Responsibility

The package owns:

- A single shared `MongoClient` (lazy, idempotent connect; graceful close)
- A health probe (`pingMongo`) backed by the active connection
- An internal `_getDb()` accessor that typed collection helpers in this
  package compose against
- Domain CRUD helpers:
  - `setKnowledgeState` — the knowledge-document state mutator. Called
    by `@bb/queue` publishers on enqueue.
  - `upsertKnowledge` / `listKnowledge` — knowledge-doc upsert and list
    (with file count joined from `raw`). Used by the github / local
    index routes and by `@bb/cli`'s `ls` and `delete` flows.
  - `deleteKnowledge` — hard delete: removes the `knowledge` doc, every
    `raw` row tagged with that `knowledgeId`, and every
    `processing_stats` commit row tagged with that `knowledgeId`.
    Called by the server's `DELETE /api/v1/repos/:knowledgeId` route.
  - `upsertRawFile` — per-file Raw doc writer (compound key
    `{ knowledgeId, relativePath }`). Called by `@bb/ingest-github`'s
    worker for every scanned file.
  - `recordProcessingStats` — upsert one `processing_stats` row keyed
    on `{ knowledgeId, commitHash }`. Called by `@bb/ingest-github`'s
    worker once per ingest run with the per-model token totals,
    estimated cost, and processing time.
  - `aggregateStats` — read every `knowledge` + `processing_stats` doc
    and assemble the kube-shaped `StatsResponse` (totals, repos,
    commitStats). Called by the server's `GET /api/v1/stats` route.
- A central registry of collection name strings (`Collections` enum):
  `knowledge`, `raw`, `processing_stats`.

The package does **not** own:

- Knowledge-document creation, full reads, or any mutation other than the
  state field (deferred — see _How to extend_)
- Document schemas (live in `@bb/types`)
- Index management (deferred)
- Neo4j / graph queries (`@bb/graph`)
- Telemetry, logging, retry policies (the driver handles transport retries)

## Public exports

```ts
function connectMongo(): Promise<void>;
function closeMongo(): Promise<void>;
function pingMongo(): Promise<PingResult>;

function setKnowledgeState(knowledgeId: string, state: KnowledgeState): Promise<void>;
function upsertRawFile(doc: Omit<RawFileDoc, "updatedAt">): Promise<void>;

interface PingResult {
  ok: boolean;
  latencyMs: number;
}
interface FileAnalysis {
  purpose: string;
  summary: string;
  businessContext: string;
  classes: string[];
  functions: string[];
  importsInternal: string[];
  importsExternal: string[];
  keywords: string[];
}
interface RawFileDoc {
  knowledgeId: string;
  relativePath: string;
  content: string;
  sha: string;
  sizeBytes: number;
  language: string;
  analysis: FileAnalysis;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

(`MongoConfigError`, `MongoConnectError`, `MongoNotConnectedError`,
`KnowledgeNotFoundError` are thrown by these functions but **defined in
`@bb/errors`** — import them from there.)

`RawFileDoc` and `FileAnalysis` are package-local for now; they'll
graduate to `@bb/types` when a second consumer (e.g. `@bb/mcp` retrieval)
needs to read Raw docs.

`_getDb()` and the `Collections` enum are **internal** — consumed only
by helpers inside this package. Higher tiers cannot reach a raw `Db`
handle; they go through typed domain helpers that this package will
expose as they are added.

## Data ownership

The single shared `MongoClient` instance. Document shapes, indexes, and
migrations are intentionally not owned here.

## Invariants

1. **No env reads.** The Mongo URI comes from
   `getConfigValue(Config.MongoUri)`. No `process.env`, no `.env`, no fallback.
   Enforced repo-wide by [eslint.config.mjs:71-94](../../eslint.config.mjs#L71-L94).
2. **`connectMongo()` is idempotent and concurrent-safe.** Repeated calls
   return the existing client; concurrent calls await the same in-flight
   connect promise.
3. **`closeMongo()` is graceful.** Clears the cached client before awaiting
   `client.close()` so a subsequent `connectMongo()` cleanly re-establishes.
4. **Errors are typed, not strings.** `MongoConfigError` carries the exact
   `bytebell set …` hint; `MongoConnectError` redacts credentials in the URI.
5. **No raw `Db` leaks.** `_getDb()` is not in `src/index.ts`. The only way
   higher tiers touch Mongo is through typed helpers exported from this
   package.

## External dependencies

- `mongodb` — official driver
- `@bb/config` — workspace dep, for `getConfigValue(Config.MongoUri)`
- `@bb/types` — workspace dep, for `Config` and `KnowledgeState`
- `@bb/errors` — workspace dep, for the typed error classes thrown here

No logger, no telemetry, no Neo4j, no Redis. This package boots after
`@bb/config` and before everything that needs persistence.

## What is intentionally out of scope (v0)

- Knowledge-document creation, deletion, or full reads
  (`getKnowledgeById`, `createKnowledge`, etc.) — added when the first
  caller arrives
- Raw deletion / `deleteRawFile(knowledgeId, relativePath)` —
  added when `github_pull` lands and needs to clean up files removed in
  a diff
- `Nodes` and `Jobs` collection helpers — deferred until callers need
  them
- Index creation / migrations
- Transactions helper
- Change streams, GridFS
- Application-level retry / backoff (the driver handles transport retries)
- A standalone "probe a candidate URI" helper for the setup form (added when
  `@bb/cli`'s setup form lands)

## How to extend

Adding a new CRUD helper (e.g. `getKnowledgeById`):

1. Pick or create the appropriate `Collections` enum entry in
   `src/collections.ts` (single source of truth for collection names).
2. Create `src/<name>.ts` (flat — repo ESLint forbids parent traversal,
   so subdirectories require import gymnastics; keep `src/` flat).
3. Use `_getDb()` to obtain the `Db` handle and access the named
   collection — never expose the raw `Db` to callers.
4. Return / accept domain types from `@bb/types`. Throw typed errors
   from `@bb/errors`.
5. Re-export the helper from `src/index.ts`.
6. Update the _Public exports_ and _Out of scope_ sections of this file.
